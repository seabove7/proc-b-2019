**Abstract:** We conducted a 93-day experiment investigating the independent and combined effects of acidification (280 - 3300 μatm pCO2) and warming (28°C and 31°C) on calcification and linear extension rates of four key Caribbean coral species (*Siderastrea siderea, Pseudodiploria strigosa, Porites astreoides, Undaria tenuifolia*) from inshore and offshore reefs on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. All species exhibited nonlinear declines in calcification rate with increasing *p*CO<sub>2</sub>.Warming only reduced calcification in *P. strigosa*. Of the species tested, only *S. siderea* maintained positive calcification in the aragonite-undersaturated treatment. Temperature and pCO2 had no effect on the linear extension of S. siderea and Po. astreoides, and natal reef environment did not impact any parameter examined. Results suggest that *S. siderea* is the most resilient of these corals to warming and acidification owing to its ability to maintain positive calcification in all treatments, *P. strigosa* and *U. tenuifolia* are the least resilient, and *P. astreoides* falls in the middle. These results highlight the diversity of calcification responses of Caribbean corals to projected global change.
